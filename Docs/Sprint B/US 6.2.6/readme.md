# US 6.2.6

## 1. Context

This task appears in the start of the project's development, to be able to create a patient profile.


## 2. Requirements

**US 6.2.6** As an Admin, I want to create a new patient profile, so that I can register their personal details and medical history.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Admins can input patient details such as first name, last name, date of birth, contact
information, and medical history.
- A unique patient ID (Medical Record Number) is generated upon profile creation.
- The system validates that the patientâ€™s email and phone number are unique.
- The profile is stored securely in the system, and access is governed by role-based permissions.

**Dependencies/References:**

It is also required that the user is registered and logged in as an admin and that the patient profile is already in the system.
The backend component of this US must be already developed.

## 3. Analysis

For this US were considered the requirements specified in the project's description and the client's answers. 
Some relevant answers excerpts are here specified:

- **

- **Question:** It is specified that the admin can input some of the patient's information (name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history).

Do they also input the omitted information (gender, emergency contact and allergies/medical condition)?
Additionally, does the medical history that the admin inputs refer to the patient's medical record, or is it referring to the appointment history?
  - **Answer:** the admin can not input medical history nor allergies. they can however input gender and emergency contact


- **Question:** When an Admin creates a patient profile, should he already register them in the system, as users that can login, or should the registration always be responsibility of the patient?
If the latter is intended, should the patient's user credentials be linked to the existing profile?
  - **Answer:** this was already clarified in a previous meeting.

registering a patient record is a separate action from the patient self-registering as a user


- **Question:** That's right, it was clarified in a previous meeting, but I'm still not 100% clarified about my question.
I understand that the Admin can create the Pacient profile and leave the User as inactive, but how does the activation happen? If that pacient eventualy wants to register himself, should there be an option to activate an existing profile? For example, associate the e-mail from registration input with the existing profile's e-mail?
The feature 5.1.3 asks for the full registration, but doesn't say anything about profiles that already exist
  - **Answer:** the admin register the patient (this does not create a user for that patient)
optionally, the patient self-registers in the system by providing the same email that is currently recorded in their patient record and the system associates the user and the patient
there is no option for someone who is not a patient of the system to register as a user

hope this is the clarification you were missing. if not, let me know.


- **Question:** So, when the administrator starts creating the patient profile, what format(s) of the date of birth will they need to enter? Furthermore, what will be the format of the Medical Record Number generated after recording the data?
  - **Answer:** From a usability perspective, dates should be presented to the user using the operating system's locale definitions. since for this sprint you are building an API, you should use a standard format like ISO 8601.

medical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential number

###  Domain Model excerpt
![DM Patient](DM%20Patient.png)

The following **HTTP requests** will be implemented:
- POST (to register the new patient profile)
- GET (to check the new patient profile)
- Get by ID (to see the patient ID in the URL)
## 4. Design

This section presents the design adopted to solve the requirement.

### 4.4. Applied Design Patterns

- **Domain Driven Development (DDD):** the focus is the business logic and not the implementation.
- **Data Transfer Object (DTO):** gives an abstraction layer to the domain, so that it's only presented specific information regarding the object.
- **Model View Controller (MVC):** allows the re-usability of components and promotes a more modular approach to the code, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Repository pattern:** allows access to data without sharing the details of data storing, like the database connection.
- **Service pattern:** helps keeping high cohesion and low coupling in the code by separating complex business logic from the rest of the system. They also promote reuse, as multiple parts of the system can use the same service to perform common operations.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD):** planning the tests previously to the code gives orientation lines to the development process.
- **Onion Architecture:** concentric layers structure that puts the Domin Model as the core. Promotes modularity, flexibility and testability.
- **Inversion of Control:** the responsability of object creation and dependency management belongs to a framework or external entity, so that the class doesn't need to. Promotes flexibility and decoupling.
- **Dependency Injection:** used to implement inversion of control. The dependencies are injected into a class from the outside.


### 4.5. Tests

The following tests are to be developed:
- the created patient profile must have the same data as the input.
- an error message should be displayed when the input is invalid or mandatory.
- the page must reload to show the new patient profile.
- a success message should be shown after creation.

Unitary tests to the component will be implemented.

E2E Tests will also check all the US flow, from the user interaction to the backend server.

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of this US is according to the design, as can be seen in the diagrams presented before.

All commits referred the corresponding issue in GitHub, using the #29 tag, as well as a relevant commit message.
The estimated duration for this US is 15h.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

To create a patient profile, run the Backoffice, Auth and the SPA app, then go to the Patient page and click on "plus" icon to add a profile.

## 7. Observations

This work was guided by the project provided in ARQSI classes.
